In restricted visibility an alteration to starboard is generally preferred to an alteration to port for.
Vessels approaching from opposite or nearly opposite directions.
In the Conference decided that no vessel should alter course to port for a vessel forward of.
The beam except when overtaking.
Rules and c impose a similar restriction on powerdriven vessels in sight of one.
Another when meeting or crossing so as to involve risk of collision.
Avoid alterations of course towards vessels approaching from abeam or abaft the beam.
Do not alter course to port in a closequarters situation this is to reduce the possibility of.
Conflicting action being taken by the other vessel.
However a substantial alteration to port is permissible for vessels approaching forward of the.
Starboard beam.
