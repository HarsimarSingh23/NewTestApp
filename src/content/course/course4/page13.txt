Canal Effect.
Hydrodynamic forces.
Are amplified because of the shallow depth of the channel.
Are greater because of the confines in the channel.
Increase the bow and stern waves.
Increase squat.
Cause greater lateral forces arising from the ships movement in relation to the banks.
The sum of all these forces results in the Canal Effect.
