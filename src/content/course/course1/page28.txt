Rule Three: General Definitions (contd.)
Power-driven vessel (contd.)
The term power-driven vessel includes all vessels propelled by
machinery for the purpose of certain Rules like Rule 19(b)
where even a hampered power-driven vessel would be
expected to have her engines ready for immediate manoeuvre
in restricted visibility.
However a power-driven vessel which is NUC, RAM or engaged in fishing will not exhibit the lights
specified in Rule 23 for a 'Power Driven Vessel', but shall exhibit the lights specified in either Rule 26 or
Rule 27 for the vessel of that privilege.
