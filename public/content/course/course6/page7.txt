Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Three

Rule Nineteen Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility (contd.)

Action could consist of an alteration to the course.

In restricted visibility an alteration to starboard is generally preferred to an alteration to port for vessels approaching from opposite or nearly opposite directions.

In 1972, the Conference decided that no vessel should alter course to port for a vessel forward of the beam except when overtaking.

Rules 14, 15 and 17(c) impose a similar restriction on power-driven vessels in sight of one another when meeting or crossing so as to involve risk of collision.

Avoid alterations of course towards vessels approaching from abeam or abaft the beam do not alter course to port in a close-quarters situation this is to reduce the possibility of conflicting action being taken by the other vessel.

However a substantial alteration to port is permissible for vessels approaching forward of the starboard beam.
