Rule Nineteen Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility (contd.)


>>> Click to see rule

a. This <bi> Rule <.bi> applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility.

b. Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel shall have her engines ready for immediate manoeuvre.

c. Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the Rules of Section I of this Part.

d. A vessel which detects by <bi> <bi> radar <.bi> <.bi> alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing and / or risk exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible, the following shall be avoided :
i. an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken.
ii. an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or <bi> <bi> abaft <.bi> <.bi> the beam.

e. Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel or which cannot avoid the close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall, if necessary, take all her way off and in any event, navigate with extreme caution until the danger of collision is over.

Fog signals apparently forward of the beam 

Reduce speed if any sound signal is heard apparently forward of the beam. The same applies to sound signals that appear to come from near or slightly <bi> <bi> abaft <.bi> <.bi> the beam.

Fog signals reported.

If the captain or officer in charge is informed that a fog signal has been heard apparently forward of the beam when a vessel is proceeding at a speed greater than steerage way the engines should be stopped or the speed appreciably reduced unless it has been determined that there is no risk of collision.

A lookout posted forward may be able to hear a fog signal before it can be heard on the <bi> <bi> bridge <.bi> <.bi> human Protector.

Fog signal of an anchored vessel.

If the fog signal of an anchored vessel is heard immediately ahead or forward of the beam speed should be taken off all the way and the engines stopped if necessary. The same <bi> <bi> rule <.bi> <.bi> applies to vessels behaving as wreck making
