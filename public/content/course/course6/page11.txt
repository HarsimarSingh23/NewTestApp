Maneuvering to get clear

When two power-driven vessels approach each other in fog and each hears the fog signal of the other forward of the beam without having ascertained that there is no risk of collision both should stop their engines take all the way off and stay in place till the fog clears.

The best plan would be for one vessel to remain stopped allowing the other to maneuver however if one vessel heard the other make a signal of two prolonged blasts she must not assume that the other vessel will remain stopped.

In the Achille Lauro - Cornelius B. case, Justice Wilmer said : As it has been pointed out in more than one of the cases cited to me it is wrong to interpret a signal of two long blasts as an invitation. It is not an invitation to come on to port. It is no more than a means of advertising to other shipping the fact that the vessel is stopped.
