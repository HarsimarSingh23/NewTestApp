Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Three

Rule Nineteen Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility (contd.)

Reduction of speed navigation with extreme caution.

A power-driven vessel is required to significantly reduce her speed or stop her engines on hearing the fog signals of another vessel whose exact position has not been yet ascertained or if a close-quarters situation is inevitable and navigate with extreme caution.

Stopping engines is the best way of bringing down speed.

However vessels may be permitted to maintain a speed higher than steerage way if radar indicates that a close-quarters situation is developing with a vessel approaching from just forward of the beam, or very broad on the bow which is expected to pass astern.
