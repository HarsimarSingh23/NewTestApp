Rule Nineteen Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility (contd.)

Avoid reversing engines astern

Full astern should be avoided as the noise of engines reversing may obscure other sound signals.

Full astern should be resorted to only after slow astern and half astern modes have been completed to avoid engine damage or seizure.

However if collision is inevitable present the smallest possible profile of your vessel to the other. For example a hit received by your vessel when she is tendon is less disastrous compared with the effect of a collision broadside.
