>>> Click to see rule

a. This <bi> Rule <.bi> applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility.

b. Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel shall have her engines ready for immediate manoeuvre.

c. Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the Rules of Section I of this Part.

d. A vessel which detects by <bi> radar <.bi> alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing and / or risk exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible, the following shall be avoided :
i. an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken.
ii. an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or <bi> abaft <.bi> the beam.

e. Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel or which cannot avoid the close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall, if necessary, take all her way off and in any event, navigate with extreme caution until the danger of collision is over.

Take all the way off if necessary

Courts have held that that vessels navigating without <bi> radar <.bi> should have reversed their engines after hearing a fog signal forward of the beam in the following instances:

● When the signal was first heard in close proximity.

● Where the signal was heard dead ahead.

● Where the signals were narrowing on the bow.

● Where a vessel was seen to loom out of the fog but her course was not immediately apparent.

● Where a sailing vessels fog signal was heard forward of the beam and.

● Where the signal was that of a vessel at anchor and the tide was setting towards her.
