Rule Nineteen Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility (contd.)

b. Every vessel must proceed at a safe speed depending on the ambient conditions. This is dictated by

● The size of the ship.

● The visibility and ambient lighting conditions.

● The physical features of the sea and the surroundings.

● The traffic area and density the vessel finds herself in.

● The maneuverability and

● The presence or absence of radar.

The extent of visibility dictates when a ship should reduce her speed. Stopping power and distances should also be considered. If the visibility is less than miles a vessel should keep her engines on-standby as a fog can develop very quickly.

Use radar to indicate the extent and movement of either a rainstorm or snowsquall and to detect other vessels in the proximity of your ship. These other saucers could also be detected when they are outside the rainstorm observed on radar.

Some captains may be reluctant to reduce speed in the light of tight schedules which they have to maintain. However at sea safety takes precedence over any schedule however tight it may be.
