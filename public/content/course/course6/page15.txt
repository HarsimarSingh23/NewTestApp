Conclusion 

In restricted visibility conditions vessels must.

● Ply at a safe speed

● have engines ready for immediate maneuver

When one vessel detects another by <bi> radar <.bi> she should determine whether a close-quartes situation exists and find ways to avoid it.

A minimum of 2 miles is the distance considered as a close-quarters situation in restricted visibility or in <bi> congested <.bi> waters.

In a close-quarters situation,

● Vessels may alter their course to starboard

● Reduce speed on hearing fog signal forward of the beam

● Navigate with extreme caution till the danger of collision is past
