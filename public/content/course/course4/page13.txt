Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

Squat in Confined Channels

Blockage Factor :

In narrow channels <bi> squat <.bi> is greater because

	● The sides of the channel restrict water flow

	● Water velocity increases

	● There is a <bi> suction <.bi> zone created amidships

Canal Effect

Hydrodynamic forces

	● Are amplified because of the shallow depth of the channel

	● Are greater because of the confines in the channel

	● Increase the bow and stern waves

	● Increase squat

	● Cause greater lateral forces arising from the ships movement in relation to the banks

The sum of all these forces results in the Canal Effect.
