Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

Canal Effect: The interactive force that throws a ship off course in a canal this could be caused by sudden changes in the bottom profile or the side profile of the channel. This could also occur when a ship gets too close to one bank with deep water on the other side.

Ship Proximity Interaction : This causes changes to the course of the vessel when another passes or is.
In close contact e.g. Replenishment at Sea. Large interactive forces are generated which affect steering, speed and handling.
