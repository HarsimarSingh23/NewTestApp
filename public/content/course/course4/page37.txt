Steering and Sailing Rules - Section One (contd.)

CONCLUSION

Navigation in narrow channels and in traffic separation zones requires some attention :

Stay as close to the border on your starboard side, as possible.

Use appropriate sound signals if you wish to overtake in a narrow channel. Avoid crossing.

Five <bi> whistle <.bi> blasts means - DO NOT OVERTAKE.

Sound a prolonged blast when approaching a bend in a narrow channel. An answering blast means there
is another vessel around the corner.

Traffic Separation Schemes, comprising two traffic lanes and a separation zone must be strictly followed.

Separation Zones are off-limits to all vessels except in time of danger.

Crossing traffic lanes should be done at 90Â°, or a reading close to it.

Avoid inshore zones, except when entering or leaving a port.

Take special care when navigating inshore zones, lane terminations and vessels RAM.

If you see another vessel flashing the signal YG, check your position and speed immediately and correct, if
found varying.
