Steering and Sailing Rules - Section One (contd.)

Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

f. On approaching a bend in a narrow channel where other vessels may be obscured every vessel must sound one prolonged blast on her whistle. If another replying blast is heard it means there is another vessel around the bend.

Extreme care and caution should be taken when navigating such bends whether or not an approaching vessel is heard.

A power-driven vessel must not get onto the wrong side of the fairway.

When two power-driven vessels are approaching a bend in a river the one with the tide against her must wait till the other passes.
