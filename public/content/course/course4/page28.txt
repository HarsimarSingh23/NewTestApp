Rule Ten Traffic Separation Schemes (contd.)

c. Vessels should avoid crossing traffic lanes, but if necessary, should cross at close to a right angle to the
general flow. This is because a 90° crossing takes the minimum of lane space, causing the minimum
obstruction to other lane users.

Sailing vessels and small craft should not impede or cross the paths of power-driven vessels.

The angle of crossing may be other than 90° in special circumstances like keeping clear of another vessel,
severe weather conditions or strong tidal currents.
