Rule Ten Traffic Separation Schemes (contd.)

Lane Terminations

Extra care has to be taken while navigating close to the end of the lanes of a traffic separation scheme.

This is because there may be many vessels entering and leaving a scheme at the same time, especially
in a crowded harbour.

Special attention has to be paid to light and sound signals when visibility is restricted.
Reduced speed and extra awareness are the keys to a safe crossing.
