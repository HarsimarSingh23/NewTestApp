a. A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> which lies to her starboard side as is safe and practicable.

b. A vessel of less than 20 mtrs. in length or a sailing vessel shall not <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.

c. A vessel engaged in fishing shall not <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.

d. A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> if such crossing impedes the <bi> passage <.bi> of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such a channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.

e. (i) In a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt, she may sound the signals prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(d).
(ii) This <bi> Rule <.bi> does not relieve the overtaking vessel of any obligation under <bi> Rule <.bi> 13.

f. A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(e).

g. Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.

b. Vessels of unto meters in length or sailing vessels should not <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> of any vessel which can navigate only within the narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> not to <bi> impede <.bi> means that the vessel should not retard or obstruct the progress of another.

This paragraph combines Rules 20(b) and 25(c) of the Regulations. It now also applies to fairways.

Both vessels must ensure that no risk of collision develops whether or not they are in sight of each other.
Also see <bi> Rule <.bi> 8(f)(i) which states that early action should be taken to avoid a collision situation from developing.

Small vessels should observe the lights and shapes displayed by larger vessels especially if they are CBD, and make the appropriate steering moves so as not to <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> of the larger vessel or cause a collision.
