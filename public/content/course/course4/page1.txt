Steering and Sailing Rules - Section One (contd.)

Rule Nine: Narrow Channels

A. A vessel proceeding along a narrow channel shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel which lies on her starboard side.

This rule deals with navigating narrow channels or fairways connected to the open sea which are navigable by seagoing vessels unless there is an inconsistent local rule. Rule a of the Regulations required a vessel in a narrow channel to keep to that side of the fairway or midchannel which lies on the starboard side of such a vessel.
