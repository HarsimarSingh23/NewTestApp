a. A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> which lies to her starboard side as is safe and practicable.

b. A vessel of less than 20 mtrs. in length or a sailing vessel shall not <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.

c. A vessel engaged in fishing shall not <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.

d. A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> if such crossing impedes the <bi> passage <.bi> of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such a channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.

e. (i) In a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt, she may sound the signals prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(d).
(ii) This <bi> Rule <.bi> does not relieve the overtaking vessel of any obligation under <bi> Rule <.bi> 13.

f. A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or <bi> fairway <.bi> where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in <bi> Rule <.bi> 34(e).

g. Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.

A. A vessel proceeding along a narrow channel shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel which lies on her starboard side.

This <bi> rule <.bi> deals with navigating narrow channels or fairways connected to the open sea which are navigable by seagoing vessels unless there is an inconsistent local rule. <bi> Rule <.bi> a of the Regulations required a vessel in a narrow channel to keep to that side of the <bi> fairway <.bi> or midchannel which lies on the starboard side of such a vessel.
