Rule Ten Traffic Separation Schemes (contd.)

A vessel is said to be using a traffic separation scheme when she is within the bounds of the scheme, not
crossing the lanes and not fishing in the separation zone.

b. A vessel using a traffic separation scheme shall

● enter the appropriate traffic lane at the start, at as small an angle as possible;

● move in the same direction as other ships in the lane,

● keep clear of a traffic separation line or zone, and leave a traffic lane at as small an angle to the
general direction of traffic flow as practicable.
