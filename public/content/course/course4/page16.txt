Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

Effect of Canal Navigation

	● Reduction in propeller speed by 15 % to 20 %
	
	● Increased turbulence around the propellers

	● Increased slipstream around the rudder

	● Larger bow and stern waves which could disrupt life in the channel

	● Increased Squat leading to decreased control

Reverse Flow in Canals

Water pushed ahead of a ship in a bow wave has to flow back past the vessel to equalize the pressure in the canal. This is called Reverse Flow. This additional flow of water increases the Bernoulli Effect between the canal bottom, the banks and the ship.
