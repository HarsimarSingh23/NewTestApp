Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

Effect of Canal Navigation

	● Reduction in <bi> propeller <.bi> speed by 15 % to 20 %
	
	● Increased <bi> turbulence <.bi> around the propellers

	● Increased <bi> slipstream <.bi> around the rudder

	● Larger bow and stern waves which could disrupt life in the channel

	● Increased <bi> Squat <.bi> leading to decreased control

Reverse Flow in Canals

Water pushed ahead of a ship in a bow wave has to flow back past the vessel to equalize the pressure in the canal. This is called Reverse Flow. This additional flow of water increases the Bernoulli Effect between the canal bottom, the banks and the ship.
