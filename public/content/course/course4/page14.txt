Bank Effect in Canals.

When a ship moves towards a canal bank.
	● The water between the side and the bank gets confined

	● The velocity of this water becomes greater

	● The bow of the vessel tends to be pushed away to the opposite bank

	● This area of water near the bow is called the Pressure Zone

Smelling the Ground.
This is another similar effect with a submerged bank or shoal. A ship passing a submerged bank experiences increased pressure in the water between the bank and the ship causing it to <bi> deflect <.bi> from the bank.
