Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

Wave Generation in Canals and Canal Speed

Every ship generates a bow and a stern wave and this is emphasized in narrow channels. Speed is reduced along with maneuverability handling and control.

Speed limits prescribed for channels and canals must be strictly adhered to. High speed may cause high energy waves capable of damaging horehound installation or other <bi> moored <.bi> vessels.

Ahead of the ship a Wave of Translation is generated moving at a speed depending on the square root of the depth. This wave can travel many miles ahead of the vessel and cause damage to the waterway itself not forgetting other canal users.

Astern, the stern wave could also cause damage to vessels moving at over-the-prescribed speed through a narrow channel.
