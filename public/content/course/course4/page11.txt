Rule Nine: Narrow Channels (contd.)

Effects on moving vessels in Narrow Channels.
When vessels pass each other through narrow channels an interaction takes place between the moving ship depending on its proximity to another. Unequal pressure develops at various points along the hull.

As interaction depends on pressure it is inversely proportional to the ships velocity. Halving the speed reduces the effect to a quarter. Some of the effects are.

Shallow Water Effect we or <bi> Squat <.bi> Proportional to the ships speed displacement and channel breadth this effect can cause the ship to bottom out or strike the bed of the channel while in motion. The first indicator is a wide wake which could be detrimental to small passing craft and coastal habitation.

Rudder effectiveness is reduced.

Squat decreases the undersell clearance when the ship is making way alongside anchored in a current or.
