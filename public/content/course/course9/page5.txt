Rule Thirty Three: Equipment for Sound Signals (contd.)
Annexure III (contd.)
1. Whistles

(d) Directional properties

Sound pressure levels of directional whistles should not be more than 4 dB below the prescribed sound
pressure level on the axis. This area extends to 45 degrees in any direction on the horizontal plane.
The sound pressure should not be more than 10 dB below  prescribed pressure levels on the axis. This
ensures that the range of audibility in any direction is at least half the range on the forward axis.
The audibility range is determined by the second pressure level measured in the 1/3rd-octave band.

(e) Positioning of whistles

Directional whistles should be positioned straight ahead.
Whistles are to be placed as high as possible on a vessel.
Avoid placing a whistle outlet behind any other object on the vessel.
Place a whistle as high above the normal height of personnel, so as to reduce the risk of hearing damage.
