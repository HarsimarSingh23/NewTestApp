RULES OF THE ROAD
Sound and Light Signal

Rule Thirty Four: Maneuvering and Warning Signals (contd.)
f. If whistles are fitted more than 100 metres apart from the other on the same vessel, only one shall be used at a time for signalling.

Signals for action which is not authorised

When a power-driven vessel which is in sight of, and within hearing distance of another vessel, takes action
which is not authorised or required by the Rules, it may, in certain circumstances, be good seamanship to
give the signals prescribed in Rule 34(a).
Sound versus Light signals

In the latest COLREGS,

● The maneuvering light is to be fitted at least 2 metres above the front masthead light.

● The visual signal may be repeated while the manoeuvre is being carried out.

● Synchronization of sound and light signals is not compulsory.
