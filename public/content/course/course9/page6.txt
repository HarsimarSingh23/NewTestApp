1. Whistles

(f) Fitting of more than one whistle

If a vessel is fitted with more than one whistle, care should be taken to ensure that both are not sounded
simultaneously.

(g) Combined whistle systems

In case there are too many obstructions to the emissions of a whistle on a vessel, a combined system
may be fitted.

The units of the combined whistle system should not be more than 100 metres from each other.
The frequency of whistles must differ from one another by at least 10 Hz.
Both or all whistles under the combined system should be arranged so that they sound simultaneously at
the press of a single button.
