Rule Thirty Five: Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility

In or near an area of restricted visibility, whether by day or night, the signals prescribed in this <bi> Rule <.bi> shall be used as follows:-

(a) A power-driven vessel making way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes one prolonged blast.

(b) A power-driven vessel underway but stopped and making no way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes two prolonged blasts in succession with an interval of about 2 seconds between them.

(c) A vessel not under command, a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver, a vessel constrained by her draft, a sailing vessel, a vessel engaged in fishing and a vessel engaged in towing or pushing another vessel shall, instead of the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule, sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes three blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed by two short blasts.

(d) A vessel engaged in fishing, when at anchor, and a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver when carrying out her work at anchor, shall instead of the signals prescribed in paragraph (g) of this <bi> Rule <.bi> sound the signal prescribed in paragraph (c) of this Rule.

(e) A vessel towed or if more than one vessel is towed the last vessel of the tow, if manned, shall at intervals of not more than 2 minutes sound four blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed by three short blasts. When practicable, this signal shall be made immediately after the signal made by the towing vessel.

(f) When a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit they shall be regarded as a power-driven vessel and shall give the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule.

(g) A vessel at anchor shall at intervals of not more than one minute ring the <bi> bell <.bi> rapidly for about 5 seconds. In a vessel of 100 meters or more in length the <bi> bell <.bi> shall be sounded in the forepart of the vessel and immediately after the ringing of the <bi> bell <.bi> the <bi> gong <.bi> shall be sounded rapidly for about 5 seconds in the after part of the vessel. A vessel at anchor may in addition sound three blasts in succession, namely one short, one prolonged and one short blast, to give warning of her position and of the possibility of collision to an approaching vessel.

(h) A vessel aground shall give the <bi> bell <.bi> signal and if required the <bi> gong <.bi> signal prescribed in paragraph (g) of this <bi> Rule <.bi> and shall, in addition, give three separate and distinct strokes on the <bi> bell <.bi> immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell. A vessel aground may in addition sound an appropriate <bi> whistle <.bi> signal.

(i) A vessel of 12 meters or more but less than 20 metres in length shall not be obliged to give the <bi> bell <.bi> signals prescribed in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this Rule. However, if she does not, she shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes.

(j) A vessel less than 12 meters in length shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals but, if she does not, shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes.

(k) A pilot vessel when engaged on pilotage duty may in addition to the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b), or (g) of this <bi> Rule <.bi> sound an identity signal consisting of four short blasts.

Intervals between signals have been prescribed to prevent seamen from hearing injury which can 
be caused by frequent sounding of the ship's whistle.

| Sound signal  | Interval            | Situation            |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| <bi> Bell <.bi> / <bi> gong <.bi>  | 1 minute           | Normal              |
| <bi> Whistle <.bi>      | 2 minutes          | Normal              |
| <bi> Whistle <.bi>      | Less than 2 minutes | Other ships close by |


CAUTION!  Sound two prolonged blasts only when the navigating officers are certain that the ship
has ceased making way through the water.
Vessels at anchor in <bi> congested <.bi> waters should give their prescribed <bi> bell <.bi> and <bi> gong <.bi> signals, but if
another vessel is approaching too close, a stronger <bi> whistle <.bi> signal should be sounded.
