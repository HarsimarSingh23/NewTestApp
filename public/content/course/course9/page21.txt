RULES OF THE ROAD
Sound and Light Signal

Rule Thirty Five: Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility (contd.)
Intervals between signals have been prescribed to prevent seamen from hearing injury which can be caused by frequent sounding of the ship's whistle.

| Sound signal  | Interval            | Situation            |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Bell / gong  | 1 minute           | Normal              |
| Whistle      | 2 minutes          | Normal              |
| Whistle      | Less than 2 minutes | Other ships close by |


CAUTION!  Sound two prolonged blasts only when the navigating officers are certain that the ship
has ceased making way through the water.
Vessels at anchor in congested waters should give their prescribed bell and gong signals, but if
another vessel is approaching too close, a stronger whistle signal should be sounded.
