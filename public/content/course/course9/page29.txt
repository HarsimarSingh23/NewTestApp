Rule Thirty Eight: Exemptions
Exemptions for certain vessels was necessary

● to allow for sufficient time for them to make the required changes in

● the positions and characteristics of lighting

● the characteristics of sound-signalling equipment

The 1972 Regulations came into force in 1977. So all the exemptions except the permanent ones are no
longer valid. The last of the exemptions expired in 1986.

The permanent exemptions in force are:

(a) Repositioning of lights as a result of conversion from Imperial to metric units and rounding off.

(b) Horizontal re-positioning of masthead lights on vessel less than 150 metres in length so that the
horizontal spacing between two masthead lights is not less than half ship length. Also the forward
masthead light shall be placed not more than 1/4th ship length from stem.

(c) Repositioning of all-round light so as not to be obscured at angular sectors > 6°.
There is no exemption with respect to the carriage of lights and shapes – introduced for the first
time in the 1972 COLREGS.
