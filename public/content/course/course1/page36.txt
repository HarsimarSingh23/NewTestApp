Rule Three: General Definitions (contd.)

Vessel Constrained By her Draught (CBD)

A power-driven vessel which, because of her draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is
following.

A power-driven vessel may be classified as vessel constrained by her draught (CBD) if because of her
draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, she is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following. Not only the depth of water but also the available width of navigable water should be taken into account when determining whether a vessel may be regarded as CBD.


A deep draught vessel navigating in an area with small underkeel clearance but adequate sea room to
alter on either side should not be regarded as CBD.  She can be considered as <bi> CBD <.bi> only if her draught is such that waters on her either side is not safe for navigation. The depth may however be sufficient for the approaching shallow draught vessel which may alter safely to either side.
