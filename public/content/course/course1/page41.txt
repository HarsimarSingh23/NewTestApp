Rule Three: General Definitions (contd.)

Wing-in-Ground (WIG) craft

A multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action.

Added as an amendment to <bi> Rule <.bi> 3 in 2001, WIGs are not to be considered as seaplanes or nonÂ¬
displacement craft. They look similar to an aircraft but are not capable of wing borne flight.

WIGs make use of the dynamic air cushion which is created by engine thrust between the lower
surface of an air foil and the water surface. They can jump over obstructions by increasing the
thrust of engines.

WIGs are required by <bi> Rule <.bi> 18 to keep out of the way of all other vessels when taking-off, landing or in
flight near the surface. When operating at the surface, they are to be classified as a power driven vessels for purpose of these Rules.
