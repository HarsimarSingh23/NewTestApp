Importance of Good Seamanship

Vessels have limitations because of their size.

The smaller the vessel, the less visual it is, either on radar or all round visibility is rather
physically.


The larger the vessel, the poorer the level of maneuverability and speed-control. Captains of large
vessels may also be restricted by bridge visibility, or by the presence of other ships nearby.
