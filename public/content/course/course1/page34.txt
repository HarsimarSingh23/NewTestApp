Application Responsibility and Definitions

Rule Three: General Definitions (contd.)

Vessel Not Under Command (contd.)


A Vessel is considered Not Under Command when she through some exceptional circumstances is unable to maneuver as required by these Rules. Circumstances must be exceptional for a vessel to qualify as nut. A vessel drifting to conserve fuel does not qualify as nut and is not justified in displaying the lights and shapes specified at 
Rule 27(a). Unnecessary use of nut lights shapes is inconsistent with IRPCS. A vessel may display NUC signals in case:


● She has engine failure breakdown.

● She is riding to anchor chains with anchor unshackled (loss of anchor).

● She has steering gear failure.

● She is a sailing vessel becalmed stranded because of absence of any winds.

● She has loss of rudder propeller.

● Her anchor is down but not holding dragging.

● Adverse weather condition may be a justified reason for a vessel to be classified nut. However the weather must be so exceptional with respect to the particular vessel that she is unable to keep out of way of another vessel which may not be so badly affected by the same weather condition.
