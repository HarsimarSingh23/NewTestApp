CONCLUSION

Prevention is better than cure.

The importance of training the watchkeeping officers cannot be over emphasized.

Collision Avoidance takes precedence over practically every other Navigational / Operational activity.

There is no lonelier person standing than the Commanding Officer of a vessel in the aftermath of a
collision!

● 56% were between 2345 – 0015 hours and between 0345 – 0415 hours.

● 63% were either end-on or overtaking situations.

● 85% were clear visibility collisions!
