Rule Three: General Definitions (contd.)

Vessel Restricted in her Ability to maneuver (RAM)


A vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to maneuver as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.

The term vessels 'restricted in their ability to maneuver' shall include but not be limited to:

● A vessel engaged in laying, servicing or picking up a <bi> navigation <.bi> mark, submarine cable or pipeline.

● A vessel engaged in <bi> dredging <.bi> surveying or underwater operations.

● A vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons provisions or cargo while underway.

● A vessel engaged in launching or recovery of aircraft.

● A vessel engaged in <bi> mine <.bi> clearance operations.

● A vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.

A list of vessels which may be classified as RAM is given in the text of the Rules. However this list is not exhaustive and may include any vessel which because of the nature of her operation is restricted in her ability to maneuver as required by these rules. A vessel at anchor carrying out replenishment with a barge alongside is not considered as RAM as she is not underway.

A vessel engaged in towing operation is not justified in displaying lights and shapes for a RAM vessel unless both the towing vessel and her tow is severely restricted in their ability to deviate from their course.

To sum up boats with restricted maneuverability whether due to fishing draft length towing or other causes, are examples of RAM vessels.
