Rule Three: General Definitions (contd.)
Vessel engaged in fishing (contd.)
All fishing vessels must show the proper lights or day shapes. If no signs are shown, then the vessel is a
power-driven vessel, regardless of what apparent fishing gear is in sight. A fishing vessel in transit to and
from the fishing grounds is a power-driven vessel. A fishing vessel has its status only when the gear is
hampering its maneuverability.
Trolling means pulling baited lines through the water.
Trolling vessels not classified as fishing vessels, but
are considered simply as power-driven vessels.
