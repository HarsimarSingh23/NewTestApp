Rules basically describe what is generally considered to be proper.

E.g. <bi> Rule <.bi> 16 describes action by a giveaway vessel and expects her to take 'Early and <bi> Substantial <.bi> Action'
to keep 'Well Clear'.

Regulations prescribe exactly what is required, correct, legal or permitted.

E.g. <bi> Rule <.bi> 28 prescribes exactly the light sound signal for vessel constrained by her drought.

Treat a <bi> rule <.bi> as a kind of implicit social contract rather than an externally imposed restriction on behavior

Train yourself to properly interpret the Rules within the parameters of the International Regulations for
Collision at Sea. This is more difficult and requires practice at sea.
