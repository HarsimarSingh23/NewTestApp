Rule Twenty Four Towing and Pushing (contd.)

Tug < 50m, Tow < 200m: The tugboat displays two masthead lights in a vertical line, with sidelights (green for starboard and red for port) and a sternlight. The tow exhibits a yellow towing light above the sternlight.

Tug < 50m, Tow > 200m: The tugboat in this case has three masthead lights in a vertical line instead of two, indicating a longer tow. The side and stern lights remain the same, and the tow continues to show a yellow towing light above the sternlight.

Tug > 50m, Tow < 200m: When the tug is longer than 50 meters but the tow is still under 200 meters, it follows the same lighting pattern as a smaller tug towing under 200 meters but with an additional masthead light positioned higher.

Tug > 50m, Tow > 200m: For a larger tugboat with a tow exceeding 200 meters, it exhibits three masthead lights in a vertical line, sidelights, and a sternlight. The tow still shows a yellow towing light above the sternlight.
