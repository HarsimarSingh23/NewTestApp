Rule Eight: Action to Avoid Collision

>>> Click to see rule

a. Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this Part, and if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.

b. Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small <bi> alterations <.bi> of course and/or speed should be avoided.

c. If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is <bi> substantial <.bi> and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

d. Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.

e. If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.

f. i. A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> or safe <bi> passage <.bi> of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe <bi> passage <.bi> of the other vessel.
ii. A vessel required not to <bi> impede <.bi> the <bi> passage <.bi> or safe <bi> passage <.bi> of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this Part.
iii. A vessel the <bi> passage <.bi> of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of this Part, when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.

B. <bi> Alterations <.bi> that are as large as possible should be made to course speed or heading unless space depth or surrounding traffic prevent such <bi> alterations <.bi> being made. This enables the other vessel to take adequate note of the alteration and make arrangements of her own.

In restricted visibility <bi> alterations <.bi> of course and speed should be <bi> substantial <.bi> so as to be readily apparent to another vessel observing her by radar. A alteration is sufficient for course and should preferably in the order of or <bi> alterations <.bi> of speed take longer to implement and are less likely to be observed. A STOP order for engines should be given followed by a SLOW AHEAD or DEAD SLOW, later.
