Rule Eight: Action to Avoid Collision

C. If there is sufficient room the course of a vessel may be altered since it is the most effective action to prevent a collision. It should however be made with ample time to spare substantial in nature and should not result in another close-quarters situation.


A distance at which a close-quarters situation develops has been left open to debate but in 
	● restricted visibility on the open sea it is at least miles in any direction forward of the beam (typically the range of audibility of the whistle of a large vessel in still conditions)

	● At least miles on the open sea considering radar observation errors.

	● less than miles when at reduced speed in congested waters while overtaking or when a vessel is expected to pass astern.

This paragraph is similar to Recommendation 5 of the Annex to the 1960 Rules, but now applicable to all conditions of visibility.
