Rule Seven Risk of Collision (contd.)

Automatic Identification Systems AIS are now fitted to vessels in accordance with the carriage requirements of SOLAS.

AIS automatically provides the following data.

	● Vessel identification

	● Type of ship.

	● Position
	
	● Course and speed

AIS can be used to advantage for collision avoidance because the identity and behavior of the other vessel can be determined well in advance. Both vessels crew are expected to make optimal use of the equipment for appropriate circumstances.

However it should be borne in mind that not all vessels are required to be fitted with AIS.
