Rule Eight: Action to Avoid Collision ( contd. )

d. Any action taken by the giveaway vessel must result in passing at a safe distance. This was introduced for the first time in the 1972 Regulations. The stand-on vessel must initially keep to her course and speed and must only take corrective action if the giveaway vessel has done nothing to change course or reduce speed.


The stand-on vessel is supposed to take such action that will aid in preventing a collision. A reduction.
Of speed may be the only alternative in certain cases but this may not appreciably affect the passing distance.


The effectiveness of action should be checked this applies especially in conditions of restricted visibility as the corresponding action of the other vessel is less obvious on a radar screen. Plotting or some equivalent systematic observation method, should be continued until the vessel is well clear.
