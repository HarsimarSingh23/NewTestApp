>>> Click to see rule

a. Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this Part, and if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.

b. Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.

c. If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

d. Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.

e. If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.

f. i. A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the other vessel.
ii. A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this Part.
iii. A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of this Part, when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.

This paragraph corresponds to paragraph of the Preliminary to the Steering and Sailing Rules of the 1960 Regulations, but now the requirement applies to any condition of visibility.

Emphasis is laid on positive action in ample time.

When vessels are in visual sight of one another the vessel directed to keep out of the way should take.
Early action to avoid a collision and comply with the direction.

An amendment to this para was adopted by the limo to clarify matters and prevent collisions from occurring it worked at linking Rule on Action to Avoid Collision and Steering and Sailing Rules of Part B.
