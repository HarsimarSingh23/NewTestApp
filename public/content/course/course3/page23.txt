Rule Eight: Action to Avoid Collision ( contd. )

e. Powering astern to avoid collisions ( contd. )

This shows the path traced out by a vessel of around tons making a crash stop after going at her full speed of approximately 15 knots.

The rudder loses effect as soon as the engines are stopped and this is the reason for the vessel ending up 
at 90 deg to her original course in either direction at the end of the crash-stop. In the case of controllable pitch propellers the deviation could be controlled to some extent.

Helm action taken in the initial stage of the crash-stop procedure will result in increased resistance and reduction in the stopping distance.

Sailing vessels can reduce time to assess collision situations by luffing up into the wind or reducing sail moving the rudder hard over to one side and then hard over to the other may also reduce speed.
