Rule Eight: Action to Avoid Collision ( contd. )

e. Powering astern to avoid collisions coned.

Caution! There have been several instances of vessels having their engines immobilized due to attempting to reverse too rapidly after going at full ahead Ideally a vessel moving at full speed should stop her engines and order a reverse after at least three minutes. Initially a slow astern then a half astern, and finally a full astern should be ordered.


The distance that a vessel will cover in a crash-stop before being brought to rest completely from full speed is around 5 to 15 to ship-lengths, varying with the speed, displacement, weather conditions, type of engine and the wind.
