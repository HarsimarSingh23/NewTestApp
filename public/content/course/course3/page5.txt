Rule Seven Risk of Collision (contd.)

Use of the Radiotelephone/VHF

The use of all available means in this context refers to the use of VHF and the radiotelephone.

In international waters radiotelephony is occasionally used to advantage.

It is a bit problematic when using the VHF radio in crowded waters especially when there are numerous other vessels of various nationalities.

The United Kingdom has issued Marine Guidance Note MGN 167 to stress the problem of wasting time in trying to make radio contact and on vessel identification instead of Concentrating on the risk of assessment and the need for action. 

There is also the danger of proposing action that is non-compliant with the Collision Regulations.

However the following points should make the use of VHF highly valuable

● The identity of the transmitting vessel should be clear.

● The status of both vessels (stand-on versus give-away) should be clear.

● The vessel taking avoiding action in restricted visibility must use VHF to inform the other about her intentions.
