>>> Click to see rule

a. Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this Part, and if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.

b. Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small <bi> <bi> alterations <.bi> <.bi> of course and/or speed should be avoided.

c. If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is <bi> <bi> substantial <.bi> <.bi> and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

d. Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.

e. If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.

f. i. A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to <bi> <bi> impede <.bi> <.bi> the <bi> <bi> passage <.bi> <.bi> or safe <bi> <bi> passage <.bi> <.bi> of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe <bi> <bi> passage <.bi> <.bi> of the other vessel.
ii. A vessel required not to <bi> <bi> impede <.bi> <.bi> the <bi> <bi> passage <.bi> <.bi> or safe <bi> <bi> passage <.bi> <.bi> of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this Part.
iii. A vessel the <bi> <bi> passage <.bi> <.bi> of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of this Part, when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.

e. A vessel shall reduce speed or take it all the way off if such an action will help in avoiding a collision reducing speed gives more time to assess the situation and make amendments to course or speed.


Taking Speed Off All The Way results in a sharp drop initially followed by a more gradual decrease if engines are put <bi> <bi> astern <.bi> <.bi> immediately the initial decrease in speed will be maintained and headway falls off faster. This is called a crash-stop.
