Rule Eight: Action to Avoid Collision ( contd. )

e. A vessel shall reduce speed or take it all the way off if such an action will help in avoiding a collision reducing speed gives more time to assess the situation and make amendments to course or speed.


Taking Speed Off All The Way results in a sharp drop initially followed by a more gradual decrease if engines are put astern immediately the initial decrease in speed will be maintained and headway falls off faster. This is called a crash-stop.
