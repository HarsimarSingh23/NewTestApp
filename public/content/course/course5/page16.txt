Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Fifteen: Crossing Situations (contd.)

Hampered Vessels

If two power-driven vessels are in a crossing situation and if one is NUC, hampered in any manner or
engaged in fishing, Rule 15 does NOT apply.

Vessels having another in tow are also equally exempt from Rule 15, as they are severely RAM. However, she should be displaying the correct lights / dayshapes prescribed under Rule 27(b).
The Rule to apply in this case is Rule 18.
