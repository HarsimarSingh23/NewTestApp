Rule Sixteen: Action by Give-way Vessel


>>> Click to see rule

Explanation: -
1. Vessels are classified as give-way and stand-on vessel only when they
are in sight of one another.
2. A give-way vessel is required to take all actions of Rule 8 to avoid
collision with the other vessel. So any alteration of course or speed must be
made in ample time and be large enough to be readily apparent.
Note: - A give-way vessel is required to avoid crossing ahead of a
power-driven vessel crossing from her starboard side (Rule 15). She is
however not required to avoid crossing ahead if the stand-on vessel is a
hampered vessel or a vessel of higher privilege (RAM or NUC or sailing
vessel or fishing vessel as per the situation) as per Rule 18.

Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take
early and substantial action to keep well clear.
