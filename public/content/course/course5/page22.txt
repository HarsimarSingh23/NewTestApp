Rules of the road
Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Seventeen: Action by Stand-on Vessel (contd.)

The Four Stages in a Collision Situation
Stage One : At long range, before the risk of collision arises, both vessels may take any action.

Stage Two : At the first instance of a collision risk arising, the give-way vessel should take action to
prevent such a collision. The stand-on vessel remains on her course and speed.

Stage Three : When the stand-on vessel sees that the give-way vessel is not taking any action to
change either her course or speed, she (the stand- on vessel) should give the prescribed whistle signal
(5 short and rapid blasts) as in Rule 34(d). She should also begin to make collision avoidance
manoeuvres.

Stage Four : When collision cannot be avoided by the give-way vessel alone, the stand-on vessel should make the required moves to keep out of the way.


Distances for each of these stages depends on the size and the speed of both vessels.
