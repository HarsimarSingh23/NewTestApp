Rule Fifteen: Crossing Situations


When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve the risk of collision, the vessel which has the
other on her starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case permit,
avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.

Vessel A is called the Stand-on vessel.
Vessel B is the Give-way vessel.
B shall keep out of the way of A.
