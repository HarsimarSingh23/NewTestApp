>>> Click to see rule

a) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of Part B, Sections I and II, any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.

b) A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22½ degrees abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.

c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.

d) Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.

b. A vessel is said to be overtaking when she comes up from either side of another from a direction more
then 22½º from the rear. In this position, at night, she should only be able to see the sternlight of the
vessel being overtaken, but neither of her sidelights.

Subsequent alterations of bearing

A vessel may overtake another on her starboard side and then subsequently make an alteration of her
course to port, so that she cuts across the bows of the vessel being overtaken. Such alteration should be
made with extreme caution so that the risk of collision is minimal.
