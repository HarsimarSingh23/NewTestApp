Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Thirteen: Overtaking (contd.)

b. A vessel is said to be overtaking when she comes up from either side of another from a direction more
then 22½º from the rear. In this position, at night, she should only be able to see the sternlight of the
vessel being overtaken, but neither of her sidelights.

Subsequent alterations of bearing

A vessel may overtake another on her starboard side and then subsequently make an alteration of her
course to port, so that she cuts across the bows of the vessel being overtaken. Such alteration should be
made with extreme caution so that the risk of collision is minimal.
