Rule Twelve: Sailing Vessels

This Rule applies to sailing vessels approaching one another.

a. When two sailing vessels are approaching one another with a chance of collision, one of them shall
keep out of the way of the other as follows :

	i. When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall
keep out of the way of the other.
	
	ii. When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel to windward shall keep out of the way of
the vessel to leeward.

	iii. If a vessel with the wind on her port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine on
which side the wind is on that vessel, she shall keep out of the way of the other.

(This Rule has been added to conform with the International Yatching Rules.)
