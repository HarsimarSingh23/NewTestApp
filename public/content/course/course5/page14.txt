Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Fourteen: Head-on Situation (contd.)

c. Whenever a vessel is in doubt whether a meeting or crossing situation exists; and whether the
approaching vessel is power-driven or hampered, she should assume this Rule applies and alter
course to starboard.

Caution : When power-driven vessels meet on reciprocal courses or crossing at a fine angle, it is important
that neither of them alters course to port. Several collisions have been caused as a result of one vessel
altering course to port and the other to starboard, in an attempt to increase the distance between them.
