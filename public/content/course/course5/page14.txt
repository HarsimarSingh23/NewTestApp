>>> Click to see rule

a. When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.

b. Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead light of the other in a line or nearly in a line and / or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.

c. When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists, she shall assume it does exist and act accordingly.

c. Whenever a vessel is in doubt whether a meeting or crossing situation exists; and whether the
approaching vessel is power-driven or hampered, she should assume this <bi> Rule <.bi> applies and alter
course to starboard.

Caution : When power-driven vessels meet on reciprocal courses or crossing at a fine angle, it is important
that neither of them alters course to port. Several <bi> collisions <.bi> have been caused as a result of one vessel
altering course to port and the other to starboard, in an attempt to increase the distance between them.
