b. When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.

c. A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with sub-paragraph (a)(ii) of this <bi> Rule <.bi> to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.

d. This <bi> Rule <.bi> does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.

d. The give-way vessel still has an obligation to keep out of the way of the stand-on vessel. She should

In case a collision is inevitable ...

	● The stand-on vessel should take the best possible evasive action.

	● In case the vessels are too close, turning to port when there is a vessel on the port beam is the
best manoeuvre.

	● The foremost concern of the navigating officer on board the stand-on vesselshould be for his ship and her crew.

	● The effect of the collision should also be as little as possible.

	● It is best to receive a glancing blow rather than a direct impact.
