Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Seventeen: Action by Stand-on Vessel

a. When two vessels meet in a crossing situation and one (the give-way vessel) is to keep out of the way,
the other (the stand-on vessel) shall progress at her same course and speed.

However, if it is observed that the give-way vessel is not responding to sound or light signals from the
stand-on vessel, when she is no less than twelve ship-lengths away, the latter must resort to collision
avoidance manoeuvres to avoid a collision with the give-way vessel.
