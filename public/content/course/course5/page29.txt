Rules of the road
Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

CONCLUSION

Sailing vessels should keep out of the way of one another and must take early and substantial action to
achieve safe passing distance. They must keep clear of fishing vessels and vessels NUC.

When a vessel is overtaking another, the former should keep clear and be aware of the forces of
attraction and repulsion that she creates with the vessel being overtaken.

The overtaking vessel should not make any sudden changes of course till she is well clear of the other.
Reading of lights at night is important to determine a vessel in a head-on situation with yours. Alter course
to starboard in case of a head-on situation.

In a crossing situation, the vessel off the port bow should give way by slowing down / altering her own
course to starboard, so as to pass behind the other vessel.

Rule 15 on crossing does not apply to vessels that are hampered in any manner. In this situation, make
changes to your course and speed as early as possible, to prevent a collision situation from arising.
