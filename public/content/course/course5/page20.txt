Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Seventeen: Action by Stand-on Vessel (contd.)

b. If in case the stand-on vessel finds herself too close to the give-way vessel and a collision scenario
looms large, the former should take any action required which will best help avoid a collision.

c. If a power-driven vessel comes across another on her port side in the give-way position, the stand-on
vessel shall alter her course, if necessary, boldly to her starboard side, to prevent a collision.
