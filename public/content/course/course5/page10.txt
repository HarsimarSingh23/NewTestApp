Rule Thirteen: Overtaking (contd.)

Forces of Attraction and Repulsion while Overtaking

When a ship moves at any speed, water pressure increases at her bow and her stern.

Water pressure decreases amidships.

If two ships pass close to each other on parallel courses, forces of attraction and repulsion are created
between them.
