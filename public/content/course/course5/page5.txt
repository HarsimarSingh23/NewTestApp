Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Twelve: Sailing Vessels (contd.)
Ambiguity in this Rule :

Paragraph (a) (iii) is a bit ambiguous. It says that a sailing vessel with the wind on the port side observing
the green sidelight of another sailing vessel to windward at night is unable to determine which side the
wind is on, for the other vessel. The first vessel is required to keep clear of the second.
