Rule Eighteen: Responsibilities between Vessels (contd.)

f. WIG (Wing in Ground) crafts have got the least privileges. While taking off, landing and in flight near the
surface of water they are required to keep clear of other vessels whether risk of collision exists or
not. When operating on water surface, not taking off or landing, a WIG craft must comply with the Rules
as a power driven vessel.
