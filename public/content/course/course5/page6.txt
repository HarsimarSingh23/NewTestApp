Steering and Sailing Rules - Section Two

Rule Twelve: Sailing Vessels (contd.)

A sailing vessel with the wind on her starboard side seeing the red light of an approaching sailing vessel
to windward at night may also be unable to determine whether the wind is on the port or starboard side
of that vessel. In this case, the first vessel should stand on her course and speed â€“ the other vessel is
supposed to give way.
