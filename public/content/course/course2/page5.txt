Lookout (contd.)

Duty of a Lookout ...

The lookout should report any lights vessels or large floating objects which he sees and in low visibility any fog signals which he hears. However in crowded waters he should use his discretion and report only those lights or objects which he feels might lead to a collision later on especially smaller craft which may not be seen from the bridge.
