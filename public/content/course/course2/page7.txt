Rule Five Lookouts and Watchkeeping (contd.)

Lookout (contd.)

Inaccurate/ defective equipment.

However if the radar or any other electronic aid is not working accurately the lookout is not obliged to use it. It should be noted that everything possible should be done to repair the defective equipment and render it fit for use.

A ship's captain may even turn off the radar if he feels that there is excessive interference from the weather (e.g. electrical storm) or any other occurrence that may damage the set.
