Rule Six Safe Speed (contd.)

Radar <bi> Interference <.bi> (contd.)


>>> Click to see rule

Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.

In determining a safe speed, the following factors shall be among those taken into account:

a.  By all vessels:

i. The state of visibility.

ii. The traffic density, including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels.

iii. The manoeuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions.

iv. At night, the presence of background light such as from the shore or from backscatter of her own lights.

v. The state of the wind, the sea and current and the proximity of navigational hazards, and

vi. The draught in relation to the available depth of water.

b.  Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:

i. The characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the <bi> radar <.bi> equipment.

ii. Any constraint imposed by the <bi> radar <.bi> range scale in use.

iii. The effect on <bi> radar <.bi> detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference.

iv. The possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by <bi> radar <.bi> at an adequate range.

v. The number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar, and

vi. The more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when <bi> radar <.bi> is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.

● Minor targets such as small coastal vessels and trainers should be detected at a range greater than 6 miles for effective action to be taken.

● Fiberglass boats and small yachts often give poor reflective images on radar.

● <bi> SOLAS <.bi> requires that all ships of less than gross tons be fitted with <bi> radar <.bi> reflectors to enable detection at both and <bi> hz <.bi> mounted at least mars. Above the waterline.

● Too much reliance however should not be placed on radar.
