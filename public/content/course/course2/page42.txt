Safe Speed


>>> Click to see rule

Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.

In determining a safe speed, the following factors shall be among those taken into account:

a.  By all vessels:

i. The state of visibility.

ii. The traffic density, including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels.

iii. The manoeuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions.

iv. At night, the presence of background light such as from the shore or from backscatter of her own lights.

v. The state of the wind, the sea and current and the proximity of navigational hazards, and

vi. The draught in relation to the available depth of water.

b.  Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:

i. The characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the <bi> radar <.bi> equipment.

ii. Any constraint imposed by the <bi> radar <.bi> range scale in use.

iii. The effect on <bi> radar <.bi> detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference.

iv. The possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by <bi> radar <.bi> at an adequate range.

v. The number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar, and

vi. The more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when <bi> radar <.bi> is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.

Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed at all times so that she can take proper and effective action to stop or change direction appropriately to avoid a collision.

The term safe speed replaces the term moderate speed which was used to control speed of vessels in restricted visibility. Since there was no term for clear visibility this one was coined which was applicable in all conditions.

The term safe is relative. The Captain and officers of the vessel are responsible to determine what a.
Safe speed is pertaining to various factors such as

● The size of the ship.

● The visibility and background lighting conditions.

● The physical features of the sea and the surroundings.

● The traffic area and density the vessel finds herself in.

● The maneuverability and.

● The presence or absence of radar.
